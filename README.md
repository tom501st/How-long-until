# how-long-until
'How Long Until' website-based project

Users can view countdowns to various events (e.g. Christmas Day) or on the 'How Long Since' page users can see 'countups' which display 
how long it has been since a particular event in days, hours, minutes, seconds. 

Users can also add their own custom dates to the mix and view them separately in the 'My Custom Dates' page. Users will need to create an account and then input the name of their event and when in happened in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format.

Built with Python (Flask), Javascript and dates stored in SQLite database.
